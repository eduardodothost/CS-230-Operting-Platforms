- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room had an Android based game they wanted to port to a browser based multiplayer online game.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - I was able to effectively fillout our software development description. We got a clearer picture of how the client could see themselves hosting and
deploying the project, making use of their current information on their user base.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  - I think the design document is a pivitol piece of living documentation that can be used to keep track of and subdivide the development of
system and design features. The more subdivisions we can break this down too, the more granular our control of the project becomes. It's a great way to
keep project development on track and lends itself to being an integral part of test driven development and quality assurance.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - Looking back, i'd like to do more digging into the logistical and practical aspects of migrating an Android game to the web. I choose to use a third-party vendor
    as a crutch for development. There be more obvious third-party solutions we can employ here using vendor specific platforms that the client is savy to. I also
    feel that the approach will be set with respect to the clients goals, mission, and vision. The client might have legacy code that may be well adapted to be deployed
    using custom netcode that they want to deploy on their own custome hosting environment.(EG they have a game den website that gives players access to the game)

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - We considered how the players would be accessing the game using web-browsers and the clients telemetry data on the current user basis. These sort of reflections
    let us attempt to visualize the extent of features that we have to consider implementing and how that effects the code and environment we need to plan for
    during development.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  - I'd like to maintain a good feedback system with stakeholders at all levels using test driven development. It gives us a good stance moving forward with
    development, with room to scale.  This sort of approach leaves less room for failure and more room for change and adaptability.
